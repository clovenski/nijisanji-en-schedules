# [Nijisanji EN Schedules](https://nijisanji-en-schedules.com/)

Single page to view some of the recent, current, and upcoming streams of the Nijisanji EN livers.

## Usage

The scheduled streams for that day will show up on the page.
Click on the streams to go directly to the stream on YouTube.
You can change to a different date on the top.
There is also a filter dropdown if you'd like to filter to a specific streamer.

Click on the top-right button to switch to *timeslot view*. 
Stream schedules will wrap around the appropriate timeslots on the page.
You can hover over the boxes to preview the stream. Clicking on it will open a popup with more info and a link to the actual stream.

## ⚠️ Notice ⚠️

This application is more of a personal project for me, so don't expect frequent updates.

It's also not free to host and power this application so it can be torn down at any time.

## FAQ

Who are you?
> Just a fellow Nijisanji fan!

Why don't I see all the schedules?
> This app will only show whatever streams that they put up on YouTube. So for example if they have an upcoming stream 5 days from now but don't have the *waiting room* up on YouTube, then it won't show here.

Does this show members-only videos?
> No.

How accurate is this information?
> The information gets updated every 5 minutes.

Why do streams sometimes disappear?
> The source (YouTube) to get the stream information is not exactly stable. The stream should show up again on the next refresh interval / update.

Are the dates converted to my local timezone?
> Yes, there is a label at the top to show the timezone they converted to.

Why don't I see the preview of the stream when I hover over the box?
> Note this only applies to the timeslot view. The preview on the right won't show if the window is too small. Try widening the window, or otherwise you can always click on the box to open a popup to view the stream information.

Will new EN livers get added here?
> Yes, they will get added once their channel gets created.

Is it possible to add other Nijisanji livers on here?
> It's possible, but there needs to be enough demand. Since this application is specific to EN, there would need to be a *big* enough demand for changing it to not be EN-specific.

Are you ever going to open-source this application?
> I can consider it if there's enough demand. I'd only open-source the front-end portion though.
