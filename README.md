# [Nijisanji EN Schedules](https://nijisanji-en-schedules.com/)

Single page to view some of the recent, current, and upcoming streams of the Nijisanji EN livers.

## Usage

Stream schedules will wrap around the appropriate timeslots on the page.
You can hover over the boxes to preview the stream. Clicking on it will open a popup with more info and a link to the actual stream.

## /!\ Notice /!\

This application is more of a personal project for me, so don't expect frequent updates.

It's also not free to host and power this application so it can be torn down at any time.

## FAQ

Who are you?
> Just a fellow Nijisanji fan!

Why don't I see all the schedules?
> This app will only show whatever streams that they put up on YouTube. So for example if they have an upcoming stream 5 days from now but don't have the *waiting room* up on YouTube, then it won't show here.

How accurate is this information?
> The information gets updated every 20 minutes.

Why don't I see the preview of the stream when I hover over the box?
> The preview on the right won't show if the window is too small. Try widening the window, or otherwise you can always click on the box to open a popup to view the stream information.

Is it possible to add other Nijisanji livers on here?
> It's possible. My initial plan was for this to be just for Enna's schedules, but quickly figured it can scale to as many livers as we want. Caveat is that there is a tedious process behind this, so there needs to be enough demand.

Are you ever going to open-source this application?
> I can consider it if there's enough demand. I'd only open-source the front-end portion though.
